# shTab

Copyright Â© 2018 Nicholas Gilbert

shTab is a replacement for the new tab page in Firefox that has shell-like functionality.

## How to Install

1. Download the install file
    The install files are located with their associated release tag. Navigate to `Tags` in the gitlab UI and you will find the `.xpi` install file there. Download the `.xpi` to your machine.

2. Navigate to where you downloaded the install file

3. Install the extension by opening the `.xpi` file with `firefox`

    You can install a particular version of the extension using `firefox shtab-$VER-an+fx.xpi` from a command prompt (tested on Linux, potentially also works on MacOS), replacing `$VER` with the version you downloaded.

    The same can be achieved through a file browser (Window, Linux, maybe MacOS) by right-clicking on the `.xpi` file and selecting "Open with..." and choosing firefox.
